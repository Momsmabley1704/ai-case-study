# THE CHALLENGE OF AI IN LARGE INDUSTRY and REAL ESTATE- A VIEW FROM AI NEWCOMER C3.AI
## Overview & Origin

Of late, a major transformation is taking place in the field of AI as related to Real Estate and its corporate owners.  Both commercial and residential.  On the residential side, the participants and players; Zillow, Trulia, HomeSnap and the like, are widely known and routinely used by millions of Americans dealing with personal real estate transactions.

My focus is the commercial real estate industry.  Its more specifically fragmented between large industrial, land, multifamily, mixed use retail, medical and a newer entrant, large Data centers. My specialty is representing single tenant users, Data Centers and large industrial customers.  Most have industry sized enterprise platforms from which they generate profits to grow their companies.  For me, successful enterprise, means profitable real estate transactions which always includes stable cash flows and predictable pricing.

## Business Activities

That's where Cs.ai comes in. Recently established and using industry standard tools like Jupyter Notebook, Python, R and Scala, C3ai's intent is to revolutionize business operations by way of generative AI for major industrial, public and private companies including Raytheon, Baker Hughes, Cargill, Koch, Johnson Controls industries, state and local goverment entities amomg many others.

Founded in 2011 by Tom Siebel of Siebel Systems, C3ai has built sales to a capitization of 3.71 billion.  Its value proposition model is providing of enterprise scale software platforms that, using an abstraction layer, allows user greater flexibility of control with mimimal need for coding expertise.  

## Landscapes

C3ai main competitors are BOX, MARA, AUR, NCNO to name a few.  At a price return of $115.60, C3ai sits in the middle tier amomg its competitors in this metric.  Presently, it's shares sell near $29.00, with earnings losses last quarter of nearly 60 million, not unexpected among AI startups.  

## Results

From my perspective and investigations, the commercial, industrial Enterprise AI is in a holding pattern.  The usual suspects are at play; high interest rates, political uncertainty, cost of capital etc.  Additionally, the short seller threat looms large for upstarts and has caused C3ai its share of heartburn in terms of stock pricing.  As a result, many analyst are in a wait and see mode, making sure not to place their toes too deep into the water.

## Recommendations

What would I recommend to stabaliize and grow the company?  One, I'd strongly reconsider using the subcription model in lieu of the current consumption model.  I believe it would provide more stratification among its mid tier and lower level customer base and in term provide an expansive customer base less impacted by market swings and short seller pressure.  And two, it wouldn't hurt for Siebel to take a lower public political profile.
